## Resubmission changes
* Made title in title case
* Changed title to include the word 'image'. It now reads as 'Wavelet-Based Enhanced FDR for Signal Detection in Noisy Images'
* Changed 'criteria' to 'criterion' in DESCRIPTION
* Checked also on R-devel (OK) 
* Put long-running vignettes in inst/doc. The minimal vignette then points the user to 'Other documentation' by typing in help(packages="EFDR"). These documents were generated using RMarkdown prior to submission of this package.
