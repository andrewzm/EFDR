Description: EFDR is a tool to detect anomalies in an image. The image is first
    transformed into the wavelet domain, the coefficients at each resolution
    are standardised, and standard statistical tests (in a multiple hypothesis
    testing setting) are carried out to find the anomalies. The power of EFDR
    exceeds that of standard FDR, which would carry out tests on every wavelet
    coefficient: EFDR choose which wavelets to test based on a criteria
    described in Shen, Xiaotong, Hsin-Cheng Huang, and Noel Cressie.
