\title{Test for anomalies in wavelet space}
\usage{
test.efdr(Z, wf = "la8", J = 3, alpha = 0.05, n.hyp = 100, b = 11,
  iteration = 200, parallel = FALSE)

test.fdr(Z, wf = "la8", J = 3, alpha = 0.05)

test.bonferroni(Z, wf = "la8", J = 3, alpha = 0.05)

test.los(Z, wf = "la8", J = 3, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{Z}{image of size \code{n} by \code{n} where \code{n} has to be a power of two}

\item{wf}{type of wavelet to employ. Please see \code{waveslim::wave.filter}  for a full list of filter names}

\item{J}{number of resolutions to employ in the wavelet decomposition}

\item{alpha}{significance level at which tests are carried out}

\item{n.hyp}{number of hypotheses tests to carry out with EFDR. If a vector is supplied, the optimal one from
the set of proposed number of tests is chosen.}

\item{b}{the number of neighbours to consider in EFDR}

\item{iteration}{number of Monte Carlo iterations to employ when determining which of the proposed number of tests
in \code{n.hyp} is the optimal number of tests}

\item{parallel}{flag indicating whether to use a parallel backend or not}
}
\value{
List with three fields:
\describe{
 \item{\code{filtered}}{the discrete wavelet transform containing the anomalous wavelet coefficients in the signal.}
 \item{\code{Z}}{the discrete wavelet transform containing the anomalous wavelet coefficients in the signal.}
 \item{\code{reject_coeff}}{indices of wavelets under which the null hypothesis of no anomaly was rejected.}
 \item{\code{pvalue_ordered}}{ordered p-values under the null hypothesis. The column names indicate the
               wavelet to which the p-value pertains}
 \item{\code{nhat}}{the number of tests carried out.}
}
}
\description{
Test for anomalies using either \code{bonferroni}, \code{FDR}, \code{EFDR} or \code{LOS} in the
wavelet domain.

\examples{
